# AI Neural Network Machine Learning
### Python program that can learn from data using different neuron structures. ( work in progress )

Run "RunNeurone.py".

You can select wich neuron will be used:
  - **Heavyside**
  - **ReLu**
  - **Sigmoide**

You can manualy give the algorithm different input / output to learn.

You can ***name*** and ***save*** each learned table that doesn't already exist.
